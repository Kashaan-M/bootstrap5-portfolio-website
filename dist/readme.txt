I have copied assets folder and main.min.css from /src to /dist folder and edited the "src" attribute in index.html because I am not proficient in
webpack bundling.
Atleast this way when I upload the /portfolio-website-bs5 to github and deploy the /dist repo on netlify then the website will work as
it is on local development server.
